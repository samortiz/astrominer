Bugs
 - scale font size smaller with smaller screens
 - shield and primary weapon bullets didn't show after loading (maybe different size ships?)
 - Factory columns overlap with narrow screen width (white text on buttons)

Minor Bugs
 - planet hugging aliens (maybe created too near planet)
 - Disable Resupply button when no ship is selected

TODO
- Add Repair button to planet for fast ship repair
- Repair should use resources based on ship cost (too much titanium needed in game)
- Factory progress bar
- Redo layout on Storage screen
- Scroll long lists
- Salvage / Destroy unwanted equipment and ships

Ideas :
- Enemy : mothership that spawns small ships when in range
- Equip : drones, Blink Lander (brake)
- continuous fire wo keypress
- zoom minimap
- Self Destruct on FlyInfo
- Switching view to planet sets view on planet (without changing ship position?)
- Planet change name
- Storage edit ship name

Maybe someday Ideas:
- Aliens destroy buildings
- Aliens build buildings
