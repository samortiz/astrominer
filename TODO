Bugs
 - shield and primary weapon bullets didn't show after loading (possibly cached graphics need clearing)

Minor Bugs
 - planet hugging aliens (maybe created too near planet)
 - Disable Resupply button when no ship is selected
 - display health on planet screen

TODO
- Factory progress bar
- Redo layout on Storage screen
- Scroll long lists
- Salvage / Destroy unwanted equipment and ships

- Shield droid : auto-deploys shield on first hit
- Melee gun : multiple bullets, high damage at short range
- Fat gun : large damage, slow fire
- Sniper gun : large damage, long range, very slow fire
- Auto-lander : Ship-upgrade... cannot crash

Ideas :
- Drone, or wing-man?
- continuous fire wo keypress
- zoom minimap
- Self Destruct on FlyInfo
- Planet change name
- Storage edit ship name

Maybe someday Ideas:
- Aliens destroy buildings
- Aliens build buildings
