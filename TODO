JS Game
- scroll minimap
- Level timing
- After crash focus on last planet with mine
- CSS on info screens 
Bugs
 - No transfer onto/off ship when ship is not on selected planet
 - blink thrusters should remove horiz momentum
 - Don't allow equipping two of the same type 
 - Creating ship after crash should find free spot on planet
 - bullets show through minimap
 - Scroll long lists

Ideas :
- AI don't all crash into you
- AI don't crash into other aliens
- zoom minimap
- Self Destruct on FlyInfo
- switching view to planet sets view on planet (without changing ship position?)
- Factory progress bar
- Alien drop (resources), pickup drops
- Planet change name
- Storage edit ship name
- Planet build turret
- Equip : extra storage, multi-shot, autoLander, gunnery droid, missiles, mines, 
- log / ticker
- landing flag (claim planet)
- toast with image/text
- Crash into buildings (maybe damage to ship?)
