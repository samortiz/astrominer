JS Game
- Don't allow equipping two of the same type

- Circular world
- Jump view to planet from minimap
- After crash focus on planet
- CSS on info screens 
Bugs
 - repair should not go negative (set max repair)
 - Storage -> UseShip button should disable when already selected
 - bullets show through minimap
 - restart in land mode doesn't redraw
 - Scroll long lists

Ideas :
- Self Destruct on FlyInfo
- Factory progress bar
- Alien drop (resources), pickup drops
- Planet change name
- Storage edit ship name
- Planet build turret
- Equip : extra storage, multi-shot, autoLander, gunnery droid, missiles, mines, 
- log / ticker
- landing flag (claim planet)
- toast with image/text
- Crash into buildings (maybe damage to ship?)
