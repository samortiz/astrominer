Bugs

Minor Bugs
 - on large screen flyInfo looks empty
 - planet hugging aliens (maybe created too near planet)
 - fire aliens have duplicate shield images sometimes
 - button images repeatedly loading (when entering fly mode) (cached 304)
 - Mobile : on my phone the background is stretched horizontally

Ideas :
- Factory progress bar
- Redo layout on Storage screen (maybe carousel?)
- Drone, or wing-man?
- zoom minimap
- Self Destruct on FlyInfo
- keyboard select secondary weapon

Maybe someday Ideas:
- Storage edit ship name
- Planet change name
- Different color planets give different resources : what kinds of resources
- Aliens destroy buildings
- Aliens build buildings
- AI to auto-transport goods (supply chain)
