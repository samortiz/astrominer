Bugs
 - Aliens + Mines show up in wrong place after death (need to set sprite visible to false)
 - Using alien ship bugs didn't reset sprite X/Y

TODO
- CSS on info screens
- hookify components
- use planetCache
- collision detection : use neighbor store? AI neighbors?  Maybe profile
- Storage shows Equip by type with tabs

Ideas :
- Visual indicator of secondary weapon ready
- Shield key c
- Scroll long lists
- Equip : drones, Blink Lander (brake)
- Enemy : mothership that constantly spawns small ships when in range
- Factory progress bar
- AI don't crash into other aliens
- Aliens destroy buildings
- double click fire to continuous fire
- Aliens build buildings
- zoom minimap
- Self Destruct on FlyInfo
- Switching view to planet sets view on planet (without changing ship position?)
- Planet change name
- Storage edit ship name
