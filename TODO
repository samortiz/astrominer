Bugs

Minor Bugs
 - on large screen flyInfo looks empty
 - planet hugging aliens (maybe created too near planet)
 - fire aliens have duplicate shield images sometimes
 - button images repeatedly loading (when entering fly mode) (cached 304)
 - Mobile : on my phone the background is stretched horizontally

Ideas :
- Messaging system: map of messages and keys, currentlyShowingMessageId, displayedMessages
- keyboard select secondary weapon
- Factory progress bar
- Redo layout on Storage screen (maybe carousel?)
- Drone, or wing-man?
- zoom minimap
- Self Destruct on FlyInfo

New Area :
 - armada has black hole to new system
 - Change progression of lighting droid and wingship to later
 - fast creeper with melee gun
 - chain lightning turret
 - enemy wingship
 - new planet colors?

Maybe Someday Ideas:
- Storage edit ship name
- Planet change name
- Different color planets give different resources : what kinds of resources
- Aliens destroy buildings
- Aliens build buildings
