JS Game
- Jump view to planet from minimap
- After crash focus on planet
- CSS on info screens 
Bugs
 - bullets show through minimap
 - restart in land mode doesn't redraw

Ideas :
- Self Destruct on FlyInfo
- Factory progress bar
- Planet change name
- Storage edit ship name
- Planet build turret
- Equip : autoLander, gunnery droid, missiles, mines
- log / ticker
- landing flag (claim planet)
- toast with image/text
- Crash into buildings (maybe damage to ship?)
